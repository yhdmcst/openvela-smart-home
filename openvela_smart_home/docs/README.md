\[ English | [简体中文](README_zh-cn.md) ]

## About openvela

openvela is an operating system specifically crafted for the AIoT industry, with a focus on being lightweight, standards-compliant, secure, and highly scalable. It has become the technology of choice for millions of IoT devices and AI gadgets, including smart watches, fitness bands, smart speakers, earbuds, smart appliances, and robotics.

The name "Vela" is originated from the Latin term for "sail," which is also the name of the constellation resembling a sail in the southern sky. We aspire to partner with developers and set sail on a voyage through the AIoT landscape.

## Technical Architecture

![img](images/002.png)

- **Kernel Layer**

    The kernel layer provides fundamental operating system functions, including task scheduling, inter-process communication (IPC), and file system management. It also supplies compact, efficient components such as device drivers, a lightweight TCP/IP protocol stack, and power management modules. This layer supports both homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-core architectures, enhancing performance support across diverse hardware platforms.

- **Service Framework Layer**

    The service framework layer is a general-purpose framework designed to extend system services. It includes connectivity subsystem, graphics subsystem, multimedia subsystem, security subsystem, and XPC cross-core communication capabilities. This layer provides flexible support for service expansion, serving as the essential foundation for system functional expansion.

- **Maintenance and Testing Tools**

    Maintenance and testing tools include common utilities and diagnostic frameworks. In addition to standard tools like Logger and Debugger, they feature the Emulator — a high-fidelity device simulator that supports full functional emulation, including CPU instruction-set simulation.  The Emulator currently supports multiple product form factors, including smart panels, smartwatches, smart bands, and smart screen speakers. By leveraging the Emulator's PC-based debugging tools, developers can perform application development and testing without physical devices, significantly reducing both development and debugging efforts.

## Version Strategy

We manage releases based on the `trunk` branch, using Tags to track release history. This ensures traceability and stability for production environments.

### Release Tags

Release tags are immutable markers created on the `trunk` branch. Each tag represents an officially released version of openvela.

- **Production Environment Recommendation**: To ensure maximum system stability and security, we **strongly recommend** using the latest release tags in production environments (Production Environment), rather than using branch code directly.

### Released Versions

Below are the currently released stable versions and their change logs:

- **trunk-5.5**: Please refer to the [v5.5 Release Notes](./en/release_notes/v5.5.md) for detailed changes.

- **trunk-5.4**: Please refer to the [v5.4 Release Notes](./en/release_notes/v5.4.md) for detailed changes.

- **trunk-5.2**: Please refer to the [v5.2 Release Notes](./en/release_notes/v5.2.md) for detailed changes.

### Hardware Adaptation Guide

To maximize efficiency and ensure code stability, we offer the following recommendations for developers performing hardware porting:

- **Recommended Baseline**: We strongly recommend **basing your development on the latest openvela release version** (i.e., Release Tags on the `trunk` branch).
- **Risk Warning**: The current **`dev` branch** is undergoing rapid iteration with frequent code updates. It may be subject to underlying interface changes or temporary instability. Therefore, it is **NOT recommended** as a baseline for hardware adaptation.
- **Self-Validation**: After porting, you can use the community-provided [xTS Test Case Collection (Chinese)](./zh-cn/test_dev_guide/openvela_xts_test_cases.md) for self-validation. It covers fundamental capabilities such as the system kernel, driver BSP, filesystem, WiFi, Bluetooth, and audio/video. Commands can be copied directly into nsh for execution without writing tests from scratch.
- **Get Support**: If you have adaptation requirements or encounter technical difficulties, please feel free to **submit an Issue** or contact us via the **WeChat Community**. The openvela team is ready to provide the necessary development support.

### Version Maintenance Strategy

openvela follows a strict version maintenance lifecycle:

- **Patch Updates**: For critical bugs or security vulnerabilities discovered in released versions, the team issues new patch release tags (Patch Release) to provide fixes.
- **Naming Convention**: Patch versions increment based on the original version number, such as `trunk-5.2.1`.

## Branch Strategy

openvela adopts a dual-branch model to balance system innovation and stability. Please select the appropriate branch according to your development needs.

### dev (Development Branch)

- **Definition**: This is the cutting-edge development branch of openvela, aggregating the latest features and bug fixes.
- **Status**: The code updates frequently and remains in a state of continuous integration and rapid iteration. It may contain features not yet fully verified, so potential instability exists.
- **Target Audience**:

    - Developers who wish to experience new features early.
    - Contributors planning to submit code or participate in core function development.

### trunk (Stable Trunk Branch)

- **Definition**: This is the fully tested main branch, representing the current stable state of the system.
- **Status**: Features from the `dev` branch are merged here only after they pass rigorous testing and verification.
- **Target Audience**: Most users who require high system stability, and engineers developing standard applications.
